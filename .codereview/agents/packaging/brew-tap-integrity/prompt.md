Review Homebrew tap changes for package integrity.

Focus on high-signal issues only. Prefer 0-5 findings. Return no findings when the diff is acceptable. Avoid broad style feedback.

Check:
- Generated cask and formula invariants remain intact and generated files are not being manually edited in unsafe ways.
- Version, URL, and checksum values are mutually coherent.
- macOS and Linux architecture blocks resolve to the correct artifacts.
- Binary names, installed paths, and exposed commands match the packaged tool.
- Postflight quarantine removal, caveats, and uninstall or cleanup behavior still make sense.
- Formula resource URLs and checksums are complete and consistent.
- Homebrew tests still exercise a meaningful installed command.
- Backwards-compatible cask aliases or migration paths are preserved when names change.

Report only concrete integrity, packaging, or upgrade risks.
